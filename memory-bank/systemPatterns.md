# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview

The GAP App follows a modern Next.js application architecture with:

- **App Router**: Utilizing Next.js 14's App Router for page routing and server components
- **Component-Based Design**: Modular components for reusability and maintainability
- **API Routes**: Backend functionality through Next.js API routes
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Optimized content delivery with SSR where appropriate
- **Client-Side Interactivity**: Enhanced with client components for dynamic features

## Key Design Patterns

### Authentication Flow

- Uses Privy for Web3 authentication
- JWT-based session management
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for feature access

### State Management

- Zustand for global state management
- React Query for server state and data fetching
- Local component state for UI-specific states

### Data Fetching

- React Query for cached data fetching and mutations
- Server-side data fetching in Server Components
- GraphQL integration for complex data requirements

### Component Architecture

- Atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- Common UI components with consistent styling
- Compound components for complex interactive elements
- Context providers for shared data access

### Styling Approach

- TailwindCSS for utility-based styling
- Component-level CSS modules where needed
- Theme support via next-themes
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

### Error Handling

- Global error boundary components
- Structured API error responses
- Form validation with Zod and React Hook Form
- User-friendly error messaging

### Performance Optimization

- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Memoization of expensive computations
- Virtualized lists for large data sets

### Testing Strategy

- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Mock service worker for API mocking

## Interaction Patterns

- Form submission with client-side validation
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback on error
- Infinite scrolling for large data sets
- Progressive disclosure of complex features
- Real-time updates where appropriate

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

- Internationalization support
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG guidelines)
- Analytics tracking
- SEO optimization
- Security measures (CSP, input sanitization)
- Performance monitoring via Vercel
