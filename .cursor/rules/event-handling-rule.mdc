#### Event Handlers
- Event handler functions should be named with a "handle" prefix (e.g., "handleClick", "handleSubmit")
- Use arrow functions for event handlers
- Define event handlers as const functions (e.g., `const handleClick = () => {}`)
- Specify proper TypeScript types for event handlers
