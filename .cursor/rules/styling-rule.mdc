#### Styling
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or inline styles
- Use the `cn` utility from `@/utilities/tailwind` for conditional class names
- Follow the project's color scheme and design system
- Use responsive design with Tailwind's responsive modifiers
- Use dark mode classes with `dark:` prefix for dark mode support
