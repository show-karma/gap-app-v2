#### Components
- Use the "use client" directive for client components
- Organize components by feature or functionality
- Use TypeScript interfaces for component props
- Export components as named exports
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Use descriptive prop names
- Use destructuring for props
- Use the `cn` utility for conditional class names
