# Gnosis Safe Disbursement Feature Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to implement the Gnosis Safe fund disbursement feature.

## Phase 1: UI and Data Handling

- [x] **Task 1.1:** Create new route and page file at `app/safe/disburse/page.tsx`.
- [x] **Task 1.2:** Implement the basic UI layout for the page, including a title and sections for each step of the process.
- [x] **Task 1.3:** Add an input field for the user to enter their Gnosis Safe address.
- [x] **Task 1.4:** Add a dropdown component for network selection (Celo, Arbitrum, Optimism).
- [x] **Task 1.5:** Add a dropdown component for token selection (initially only USDC).
- [x] **Task 1.6:** Create and integrate a CSV file uploader component.
- [x] **Task 1.7:** Add `papaparse` to the project for CSV parsing (`yarn add papaparse` and `yarn add @types/papaparse -D`).
- [x] **Task 1.8:** Implement the client-side logic to parse the uploaded CSV file.
- [x] **Task 1.9:** Create a review component/section to display the parsed data from the CSV in a table format.
- [x] **Task 1.10:** Implement validation logic to check for valid wallet addresses and positive amounts in the parsed data.
- [x] **Task 1.11:** Display validation errors clearly in the review table, highlighting incorrect rows.
- [x] **Task 1.12:** Add a "Disburse Funds" button that is disabled by default.

## Phase 2: Pre-flight Checks and Transaction Preparation

- [x] **Task 2.1:** Create a new configuration file (e.g., `config/tokens.ts`) to store token contract addresses.
- [x] **Task 2.2:** Populate the config file with the official USDC contract addresses for Celo, Arbitrum, and Optimism.
- [x] **Task 2.3:** Add the Safe{Core} SDK dependencies to the project: `@safe-global/protocol-kit`, `@safe-global/api-kit`, `@safe-global/safe-core-sdk-types`, and `ethers`.
- [x] **Task 2.4:** Implement a function that, given a Safe address, a signer address, and a network, checks if the signer is an owner of the Safe.
- [x] **Task 2.5:** Implement a function to fetch the USDC balance of the specified Gnosis Safe to ensure it's sufficient for the total disbursement amount.
- [x] **Task 2.6:** Integrate these pre-flight checks to run after the user has entered all required information (Safe address, network, and valid CSV).
- [x] **Task 2.7:** Enable the "Disburse Funds" button only after all pre-flight checks have passed successfully.
- [x] **Task 2.8:** Implement the logic to prepare the batched transaction using the Safe Protocol Kit. This will involve creating a multi-send transaction from the validated disbursement data.

## Phase 3: Signing, Execution, and Feedback

- [x] **Task 3.1:** Implement the `onClick` handler for the "Disburse Funds" button.
- [x] **Task 3.2:** Inside the handler, use the Protocol Kit to have the connected EOA sign the prepared batch transaction.
- [x] **Task 3.3:** Use the API Kit to propose the signed transaction to the Safe Transaction Service.
- [x] **Task 3.4:** Implement UI feedback to show a "processing" or "loading" state while the transaction is being signed and proposed.
- [x] **Task 3.5:** On successful proposal, display a success message. This message should include a link to the Gnosis Safe web interface where the user can see and execute the pending transaction.
- [x] **Task 3.6:** If any part of the process fails, display a clear and user-friendly error message.
