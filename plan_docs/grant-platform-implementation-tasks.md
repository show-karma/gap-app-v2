## Testing Approach (Updated)

**IMPORTANT**: Tests are now written immediately after completing each task, not at the end. Each task completion includes:
1. Implementation of the feature
2. Writing comprehensive tests
3. Verification that tests pass (may require type fixes)
4. Checking off the task as complete

**Note**: Some type issues exist with HttpException constructor that need to be resolved across the test suite. Tests are structurally complete and cover all functionality.

  - [ ] Resolve mock configuration issues

- [ ] **Integration Tests** (To be completed after API routes)
  - [ ] Test complete API workflows
  - [ ] Test database operations
  - [ ] Test AI evaluation pipeline
  - [ ] Test export functionality

### Frontend Testing

---

**Total Estimated Time**: 8 weeks
**Team Required**: 1 Full-stack Developer
**Dependencies**: OpenAI API access, existing GAP infrastructure

*This task breakdown provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing the Grant Platform MVP. Each task includes specific deliverables and can be tracked independently for project management purposes.*

## Updates Made

**OpenAI Integration**: Updated to reuse existing OpenAI utilities in the codebase:
- Task 1.2.3 now creates `evaluateGrantApplicationUsingAI.ts` in `/util/openai/` following the pattern of existing `evaluateMilestoneUsingAI.ts`
- Reuses existing OpenAI configuration and `retryWithExponentialBackoff` utility
- Follows established codebase patterns rather than creating a separate service class
