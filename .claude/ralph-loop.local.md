We should have the perfect match with the PRD and with that is implemented. Regarding just the Frontend, we won't touch backend
. Analyse one point of the PRD payout_system_prd.md
. Compare with what was implemented
. If have different things, write into a differences.md
. Go to next point and repeat 
. Output: <promise>DONE</promise>
